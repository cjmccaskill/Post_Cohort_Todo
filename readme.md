# Post Cohort Todo List
## by Alex Merced

## Preface

Now that you've completed your General Assembly Cohort, the mission to find your first role in the tech industry begins. You should allocate the hours you'll been dedicating to class to this mission.

My recommendation is to split this time:
- 25% Doing Code Challenges
- 25% Learning New Tech or Solidifying Foundation
- 25% Sending Out Job Application (2 SOLID Applications per hour)
- 25% Networking and Branding

## Doing Code Challenges

You can do coding challenges at the following places:
- [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [l33tcode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [SqlZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/)
- [CoderByte](https://coderbyte.com/)

Advice:
- organize your answers into a repo, to help build your github commit history and to make easy employers to see your practice
- have a scratch file open to try out idea or test out things you want to try in isolation before applying it to the challenge
- Don't hesitate to read langauge documentation to get more depth about something unclear
- Add comments that explain your logic, so people who review your practice can appreciate your thought process
- Don't rush to do hard coding challenges, often the simplest ones will actually be some of those fruitful ones

## Learning New Tech or Solidifying Foundation

Bottom Line, you want a solid foundation in Javascript, so the first thing everyone should do post cohort is review and reinforce their javascript fundamentals by completing this freecodeacademy course.

- [Free Javascript Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)

Other Great Free Courses to Expand Skills:
- [Learn how to build an API in 8 Languages](https://git.generalassemb.ly/AlexMerced/SEIRPolyglot)
- [MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/)
- [Severless Framework Courses](https://www.serverless.com/courses/)
- [FaunaDB Courses/TUtorials](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/tutorials/index.html)
- [Fullstack with SailsJS](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/tutorials/full-stack-java-script-with-sails)
- [StrapiJS Docs and Tutorials](https://strapi.io/resource-center)

As you learn things, build small projects to practice what you learned and deploy them!

## Sending Out Job Application

- Expect output of 2 Quality Applications in one hour (Custom Cover Letter + Resume)
- For each quality resume supplement with 3 LinkedIn Quick Apply's


## Branding Networking

- Add 10 developers, recruiters in your target area per day on linked in
- Make one post each day about something interesting code wise (a cool trick you learned, etc.)
- Create and distribute a podcast for free with Anchor.fm and use it as a soundboard to discuss coding concepts and interview other developers as a way to network with developers you'd like to know better (they may not want private message back in forth, but may be enticed by being promoted in a podcast).
- Create a youtube channel and record yourself doing code challenges and explaining your process
- Blog on dev.to, if you get a lot of views, you may be hired by LogRocket or Digital Ocean to write posts at $300+ per post
- Offer Local Restaurants, Photographers, etc. free websites to build a reputation and portfolio. If they are happy they can recommend you to paying clients.
