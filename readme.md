# Post Cohort Todo List
## by Alex Merced

## Preface

Now that you've completed your General Assembly Cohort, the mission to find your first role in the tech industry begins. You should allocate the hours you'll been dedicating to class to this mission. Also, once you do find a role you may lose access to the GA Students Slack, to stay in touch join the devNursery.com slack and discord communities.

## Building Your Brand

## Post-Cohort Resources from other Instructors
- [Code Every Day](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SEIR-teams-materials/code-every-day)

**Advice from your Outcomes Coach Should always be followed as they present it, below is just tips based on my experience, I do not have same expertise as your career coach on how to structure your search**

My recommendation is to split this time:
- 25% Doing Code Challenges
- 25% Learning New Tech or Solidifying Foundation
- 25% Sending Out Job Application (2 SOLID Applications per hour)
- 25% Networking and Branding

## Doing Code Challenges

**You can do coding challenges at the following places:**
- [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [CodeSignal](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard)
- [l33tcode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [SqlZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/)
- [CoderByte](https://coderbyte.com/)

**Advice:**
- organize your answers into a repo, to help build your github commit history and to make easy employers to see your practice
- have a scratch file open to try out idea or test out things you want to try in isolation before applying it to the challenge
- Don't hesitate to read langauge documentation to get more depth about something unclear
- Add comments that explain your logic, so people who review your practice can appreciate your thought process
- Don't rush to do hard coding challenges, often the simplest ones will actually be some of those fruitful ones

## Computer Science and Assessments

- If you haven't already complete the computer sceince modules at myGA
- Watch this [Computer Science Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY6oTPmKnKbbfwjU1ToZlUWCinxmFqlIp)
- Watch all the [100 Seconds of Code Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC471a9qrU4&list=PL0vfts4VzfNiI1BsIK5u7LpPaIDKMJIDN)

Take assessments on LinkedIn and TripleByte.com, top scores get filtered to employers as top picks. They can be taken multiple times so take an assessment and take notes of topics you may want to review for future attempts.

## Learning New Tech or Solidifying Foundation

Bottom Line, you want a solid foundation in Javascript, so the first thing everyone should do post cohort is review and reinforce their javascript fundamentals by completing this freecodeacademy course.

- [Free Javascript Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)

Other Great Free Courses to Expand Skills:

- [Fullstack with SailsJS](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/tutorials/full-stack-java-script-with-sails)
- [StrapiJS Self-Hosted Headless CMS Docs and Tutorials](https://strapi.io/resource-center)

As you learn things, build small projects to practice what you learned and deploy them!

## Learning New Languages
The Repository below has the lessons and the build to learn how to build a full crud API in 8 Languages!
- [POLYGLOT REPO](https://git.generalassemb.ly/AlexMerced/POLYGLOT)

## Sending Out Job Applications

- Expect output of 2 Quality Applications in one hour (Custom Cover Letter + Resume)
- For each quality resume, I personally would supplement with 2 LinkedIn Quick Apply's

SEIR-STUDENTS
Goal: Minimum 10 hours/wk, 20 Quality Application, + 40 LinkedIn Easy Applies (60 Applications a week)

SEIR-FLEX STUDENTS
Goal: Minimum 5 hours/wk, 10 quality applications, + 20 LinkedIn Easy Applies (30 applications a week, MINIMUM)


## Branding Networking

- Add 10 developers, recruiters in your target area per day on linked in
- Make one LinkedIn post each day about something interesting code wise (a cool trick you learned, etc.)
- Create and distribute a podcast for free with Anchor.fm and use it as a soundboard to discuss coding concepts and interview other developers as a way to network with developers you'd like to know better (they may not want private message back in forth, but may be enticed by being promoted in a podcast).
- Create a youtube channel and record yourself doing code challenges and explaining your process
- Blog on dev.to, if you get a lot of views, you may be hired by LogRocket or Digital Ocean to write posts at $300+ per post
- Offer Local Restaurants, Photographers, etc. free websites to build a reputation and portfolio. If they are happy they can recommend you to paying clients.

## Bonus Tips on Freelancing

A Powerful Combination for Freelancing is the Headless CMS + Static Site Generator Combo (The JAM Stack).

**LIST OF HEADLESS CMS:**
*Headless CMS provides a GUI create content that is then provided to your frontend via a REST or GraphQL API*
- [Wordpress API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/)
- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
- [ButterCMS](https://buttercms.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwlMaGBhD3ARIsAPvWd6jIG_myUFBq7BNNonCDZZxtz2UGrv-MMz3M2iXG-X3-gEtPbCU8wSoaAjnJEALw_wcB)
- [AgilityCMS](https://agilitycms.com/)
- [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/)
- [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/)
- For more checkout JAMStack.org

**Static Site Generators**
They pull information from different sources like a Headless CMS or your own custom API, and use your code written in your favorite frontend framework to generate a static HTML/CSS/JS web page that is fast, secure and better for SEO.
- Gatsby(React)
- NextJS(React)
- Astro(React/Svelte/Vue)
- JungleJS(Svelte)
- SvelteKit(Svelte)
- ElderJS(Svelte)
- Gridsome(Vue)
- Nuxt(Vue)
- Scully(Angular)
- Eleventy (EJS, Handlebars, Pug, Liquid)
- For more checkout JAMStack.org

So by Pairing a Headless CMS with a SSG, you can give your client a GUI dashboard they can manage their website but make it fast, low cost, secure and amazing for SEO by statically generating the output. A must learn for freelancing.
